    <h1>Dear, my love</h1>

    <p>I’m writing this letter because I feel like I’m trapped in a void.
    It might sound heavy—I know—but I hope you’ll take a quiet moment to sit with this and read each word slowly, to understand what’s been happening beneath the surface of my mind.</p>

    <p>Most days, I feel like I’m nothing more than an ordinary person—plain, unnoticed.
    There’s always someone out there better than me, more capable, more sure of themselves. But even so, I’ve always had this fire in me, a desire to be the best version of myself—not for the world, but for me… and for us.</p>

    <p>I’ve tried to learn, to train, to keep pushing. I feed my motivation with hopes and dreams, shaping myself into the person I’ve always wanted to become. But more often than not, I find myself falling into the abyss of disappointment—a void I somehow built with my own hands.</p>

    <p>It feels like I’m never enough. No matter how hard I try, I can never reach the destination I imagined.
    And the harder I chase it, the further it seems to slip away. It’s exhausting.
    Sometimes I wonder if I’m just running in circles—if all this effort, all this struggle, is just a way of distracting myself from the truth that maybe... maybe I don’t even know who I truly am anymore.</p>

    <p>My anxiety creeps in quietly and stays longer than it should.
    It whispers doubts, makes me second-guess my every choice—every word, every step. It makes me feel small, like a shadow of myself. I want to be strong, to hold it all together. But some days, I just can’t.
    Some days I feel like I’m breaking into pieces, silently, while wearing a smile.</p>

    <p>And yet, in all of this… you.
    You’re the one constant I hold on to.
    Your presence calms the storm in me more than you know. But even with you beside me, I struggle to silence the noise inside.
    I don’t want my darkness to ever dim your light, and I worry—deeply—that one day you’ll grow tired of holding me up when I can’t stand tall on my own.</p>

    <p>This letter isn’t about asking you to fix me.
    It’s not about answers or solutions.
    It’s just me, letting you in—because if there’s one person I trust with the fragile parts of me, it’s you.</p>

    <p>I’m scared about the future, love.
    About the decisions I have to make. About the life I’m trying to build. Sometimes I feel like I’m standing at a crossroads, unsure which path leads to peace and which one leads to more regret.
    But I promise you this: I’m trying. Every single day, I’m trying to find my way, to grow, to heal, to be whole again.</p>

    <p>Thank you for being patient with me.
    Thank you for loving me even when I can’t love myself.
    I just needed you to know what I haven’t been able to say out loud.</p>

      With all my love,<br>
